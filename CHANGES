* Version 3
- Missing List.of_seq/List.to_seq
- Remove spurious Float.seeded_hash_param
  (suggested by Hezekiah M. Carty:
   https://github.com/thierry-martinez/stdcompat/pull/2)
- Compatibility with seq and result packages
  (suggested by Hezekiah M. Carty:
   https://github.com/thierry-martinez/stdcompat/issues/1)
- Magic implementations of {Set,Map,Hashtbl,Queue,Stack}.to_seq*,
  Hashtbl.filter_map_inplace, Hashtbl.stats, Stack.fold,
  Set.find*, Set.map.
  Pure implementations are available by building with
  "make USE_MAGIC=false"
- jbuild script (Hezekiah M. Carty)

* Version 2
- Redefinitions for Pervasives are now in Stdcompat.Pervasives (they were
  previously defined at the root of Stdcompat), and the module
  Stdcompat.Pervasives is included in Stdcompat, so that opening Stdcompat
  makes the redefinitions visible in the scope.
- Float module (OCaml 4.07.0)
- Seq module and of_seq/to_seq/...

* Version 1 : initial release
