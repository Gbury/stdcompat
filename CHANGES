* Version 3
- Float module (OCaml 4.07.0)
- Seq module and of_seq/to_seq/...

* Version 2
- Redefinitions for Pervasives are now in Stdcompat.Pervasives (they were
  previously defined at the root of Stdcompat), and the module
  Stdcompat.Pervasives is included in Stdcompat, so that opening Stdcompat
  makes the redefinitions visible in the scope.

* Version 1 : initial release
